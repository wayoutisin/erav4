Prompt:

Build a Flask web application for managing daily appointments at a clinic, supporting peer-to-peer appointment management and reducing wait times collaboratively.

Requirements:

The app should maintain a register of today’s patient appointments (hardcode a sample list for demonstration).

For each patient, display:

Patient name

Scheduled appointment time

Current wait time (in minutes)

Status (waiting/completed)

Location (hardcode a few realistic locations and distances from the clinic)

Start time from home: Calculate and show the time when the patient should leave home, based on appointment time and distance. For this prototype, hardcode distances and suggested start times for sample patients.

Each patient entry should have a button to mark their appointment as completed.

When marked completed, all remaining patients' wait times decrease by 5 minutes.

The patient’s status updates to completed.

There must be a form to add a new patient for today, including name, scheduled time, location (predefined options or text box), and calculated/provided distance and start time.

The app should update the UI dynamically to show all changes in real time (use Flask routes/AJAX as needed).

Store all registers in server memory for the demo (no database).

Provide clear, brief instructions on the main page explaining the peer-to-peer system and patient actions.

For all patients, location, distance from clinic, and “leave home by”/start time should be visible, using hardcoded sample data.
