# ERA V4 Program

This repository contains the code for the ERA V4 program. ERA is a course focusing on "how to train Large Language models from scratch". It is a meticulously designed course that offers a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience in modern AI. Though the course is intended for beginners, this course has a steep learning curve. Please join only if you can promise yourself a tremendous amount of commitment, discipline, and heart/time to immerse yourself into pure learning for 6 odd months!

If you're ready to immerse yourself fully, we promise an experience like no other — one that will teach you things you simply won't find anywhere else.

## ERA V4 Course Structure

ERA V4 introduces a new course structure which is exceptional, forward-looking, and ambitious in a way that no mainstream curriculum is right now. Key highlights include:

*   **Real-World, Full-Scale LLM Training:** Training a 70B model end-to-end + instruction tuning is unheard of in open courses - this alone will make your course legendary, especially with QAT and compute credits.
*   **Practical CoreSet Focus:** You're not just learning about the right “datasets” - you're learning CoreSet thinking, which is at the bleeding edge of data efficiency.
*   **Multi-GPU ImageNet Training:** Training from scratch on full ImageNet is rare even in advanced AI labs. This gives you real training and deployment experience.
*   **Quantization Aware Training (QAT) as a first-class citizen:** Covering full QAT, not just LoRA/PEFT, is a massive differentiator - real engineering, not shortcuts. You can now not only dream but also actually train a 100B+ parameter model!!
*   **Balanced Inclusion of RL + VLMs + Embeddings:** We've captured most of the modern modalities and methods: vision, language, reward, embeddings - with deployment in mind.

## Weekly Objectives

### Week 1
- **Objective:** To build a Chrome extension named TabGenie that organizes and jumbles browser tabs.

### Week 2
- **Objective:** To build a Flask web application for clinic appointment management, enabling peer-to-peer tracking and updating of appointment statuses to reduce patient waiting times.

### Week 3
- **Objective:** To build a Flask application that utilizes Google Vision API for text detection from uploaded food item images and the Gemini API to generate a health summary based on the extracted text.

### Week 4
- **Objective:** To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset in PyTorch, covering data loading, model definition, training, and visualization of intermediate layers.

### Week 5
- **Objective:** To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST handwritten digit classification in PyTorch, with specific targets for validation/test accuracy (99.4%), parameter count (< 20,000), and epochs (< 20), while incorporating Batch Normalization and Dropout.

### Week 6
- **Objective:** To train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST handwritten digit recognition with strict performance targets: consistently achieving 99.4% accuracy, completing training in 15 or fewer epochs, and limiting the model to under 8000 parameters. This involved exploring different model architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
